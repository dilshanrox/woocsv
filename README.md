## WooCommerce Export to CSV/EXCEL/PDF

Admin users are able to download the list of orders in two ways by using the Woo-export-CSV plugin that I have developed.

1. Can do quick export by clicking Export to CSV button
2. Can export to CSV/Excel or PDF by clicking Custom Export to CSV/Excel/PDF button. Admin can get selected data from this option.
